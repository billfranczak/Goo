Instructions for running game:

Pressing "ready" will attempt to make a match over the internet. If playing solo for testing purposes, use the spacebar to skip this process.

Rules: You may pick up "stones" to place by hovering the mouse over the bottom left square and then place them on the board. 
Player 1 controls the left hand, and can also control a dummy version of the right hand to simulate player 2 using right click and the right pile of stones.
When stones are placed, control is given to the player whose stone is closest for each cell on the board, i.e., the voronoi diagram decides the scoring.
You may place your stones in a pile (fast but innefficient in terms of ammo) by briefly holding mouse over the stone pile, or pick up many stones to spread out,
which is slower but more efficient.
